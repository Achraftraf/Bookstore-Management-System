# Bookstore-Management-System
This mini-project aims to provide students with a hands-on experience in full-stack web development by integrating Java Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend. The project involves creating a Bookstore Management System, where users can perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.
